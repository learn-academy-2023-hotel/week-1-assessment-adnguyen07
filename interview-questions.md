# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Type your initials here to confirm you read the instructions: AN

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer: A conditional statement utilizes if/else to set parameters for specific results of a program to occur.

Researched answer: A conditional statement is programming code with narrowly defined instructions to provide particular outputs depending on whether an input value returns a Boolean value of true or false.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is programming code specifically designed as quality control of other written code. Github is a system made for web developers and programmers to create repositories of working code to build and test until it's ready to be integrated into a project.

Researched answer: Git is an open-source version control system for coding. Github is an online platform utilizes git version control and allows developers to share and store code as they create it.

2. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: The index is the position of the data in an array. The value is the actual data contained in the array.

Researched answer: The index is the particular location of each element in an array. The value is the specific data content in each element.

3. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Arrays are ordered values of data. Strings are a primitive data type that consists of a sequence of characters. Arrays can contain any data type including strings. Arrays and strings arrange information in a specific order. Certain built-in methods work on arrays but not strings and vice versa.

Researched answer: Strings are a series of characters wrapped in quotation marks. Arrays are collections of ordered data. Arrays can contain any data type that JavaScript recognizes. Strings are a primitive data type. Both arrays and strings order information, have a length property, and utilize zero-index.

4. STRETCH: What are the four pillars of object oriented programming?

Researched answer: Abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Abstraction is simplifying and organizing code in a more efficient manner.
Encapsulation is combining code and data together to keep it more organized and less likely to be unintentionally changed.
Inheritance is creating new classes of code based on already existing code in order that the new classes exhibit attributes similar to the parent class.
Polymorphism is a type of abstraction that allows different classes of code to perform similar behavior.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Higher Order Functions: A built-in JavaScript method that uses a function as its argument

2. Jest:A JavaScript testing framework

3. Objects: A JavaScript data type consists of groupings of key:value pairs
